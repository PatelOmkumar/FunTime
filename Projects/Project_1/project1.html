            <h2>The Great Swimmer</h2>
            <p>While swimming, I enjoy doing many things from swimming in different styles to jumping into the pool to create a large splash! Swimming is the action of moving through water. While swimming, you can use many different techniques and do it for many purposes. The purposes you can swim are for sports or leisure. In addition, you can use the numerous techniques which all include using different strokes. Swimming is very enjoyable and I enjoy it for the many benefits for your health. Lastly, swimming may be a very basic action, but not everyone can do it. Almost anyone can swim, but only few can master it.</p>
